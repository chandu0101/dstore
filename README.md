# Code of Conduct
If you want live happily in sri org, you need to adapt to two simple things diversity and equality.

# Diversity:

Realise the fact that not every human Mother Tongue is English.

If you find someones English is not good,try to help that person or just ignore and do your work.

# Equality:

What ever tag(CEO,VP,Lead,Sr.Dev,Architect,Jr.Dev,..) you have before your name,you're just another human being on this planet.

If you find someone doing wrong technically,try fixing it by sending a PR/guide constructively or just ignore and do your work.
